## Data

- data/stimuli/*.jpg                  stimuli files
- data/tidy/fixations.mat             eye-tracking data (fixation points and durations)


## Dependencies

- lib/gbvs 							  Graph-Based Visual Saliency http://www.vision.caltech.edu/~harel/share/gbvs.php
- lib/simplemkl 				      SimpleMKL http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/enseignants/~arakoto/code/mklindex.html


Getting Started
================
This code was tested on Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04 and MacOS, it only requires some simple modification of pathname before runing on Windows.  
To run this code, open Matlab and run demo.m to compute the fixation maps, the feature maps, to learn saliency model and compute saliency map. 
In this demo, we only use 6 features to simplify the process, which requires about 10G memory and takes 10-20 minutes.



Output:
- data/                              the trained model    
- data/featuremap                    the computed feature maps
- data/refined_saliencymap           the final output saliency map
